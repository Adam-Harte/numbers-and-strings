		<h3>Number</h3>
		<p>
			All numbers in JavaScript are technically floating point numbers even if
			you deifne them as integers. Specifically they are 64 bit floating point
			values meaning there is 64 bites set to represent the value 1 bit for the
			positive or negative sign and the rest for the number and decimal place
			digits. Due to the 64 bit size there is a limit to the size of the number
			you can define which you can see via the Number object which can give you
			access to the max and min numbers and values.
